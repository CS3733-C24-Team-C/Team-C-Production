  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `login` on the `Employees` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `employeeId` on the `Requests` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `nodeId` on the `Requests` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `username` to the `Employees` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `role` on the `Employees` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Added the required column `employeeID` to the `Requests` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `nodeID` to the `Requests` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
